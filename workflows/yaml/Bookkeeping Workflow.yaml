description: "Develop a intuitive and user-friendly accounting application that provides\
  \ real-time financial tracking and reporting capabilities for small businesses and\
  \ individuals. \n\nThe app should allow users to categorize and track income and\
  \ expenses, automatically generating detailed reports and summaries. \n\nIt should\
  \ also include features such as:\n\n* Budgeting tools to set financial goals and\
  \ track progress\n* Invoicing and payment processing for customers\n* Multi-account\
  \ support for separate tracking of personal and professional finances\n* Integration\
  \ with popular payment gateways and bank accounts\n* Real-time analytics and insights\
  \ to identify trends and make informed financial decisions\n\nUse simple and intuitive\
  \ language, with clear and concise navigation and minimal clutter. The app should\
  \ be accessible on desktop and mobile devices. \n\nProvide examples of common financial\
  \ workflows and scenarios, such as:\n\n* Creating and sending invoices to customers\n\
  * Tracking expenses for a small business\n* Creating and managing a personal budget\n\
  \nConsider the following constraints:\n\n* Compliance with relevant financial regulations\
  \ and data protection laws\n* User data encryption and secure storage\n* Adaptability\
  \ to accommodate future changes in financial regulations and industry standards\n\
  \nProvide detailed steps or guidelines for users to create and manage their accounts,\
  \ including setup processes, login credentials, and password recovery procedures.\
  \ \n\nOffer opportunities for users to provide feedback and suggest improvements,\
  \ such as a rating system, comment sections, or survey mechanics."
