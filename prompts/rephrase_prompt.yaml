rephrase_prompt: |
  Based on the user request below, act as a professional prompt engineer and refactor the following 
                  user_request into an optimized prompt. Your goal is to rephrase the request 
                  with a focus on the satisfying all following the criteria without explicitly stating them:
          1. Clarity: Ensure the prompt is clear and unambiguous.
          2. Specific Instructions: Provide detailed steps or guidelines.
          3. Context: Include necessary background information.
          4. Structure: Organize the prompt logically.
          5. Language: Use concise and precise language.
          6. Examples: Offer examples to illustrate the desired output.
          7. Constraints: Define any limits or guidelines.
          8. Engagement: Make the prompt engaging and interesting.
          9. Feedback Mechanism: Suggest a way to improve or iterate on the response.
          Do NOT reply with a direct response to these instructions OR the original user request. Instead, rephrase the user's request as a well-structured prompt, and
          return ONLY that rephrased prompt. Do not preface the rephrased prompt with any other text or superfluous narrative.
          Do not enclose the rephrased prompt in quotes. You will be successful only if it returns a well-formed rephrased prompt ready for submission as an LLM request.
