prompt: 'Here is the rephrased prompt:


  Design a basic accounting system for a small business, incorporating the following
  features:


  Track income and expenses for a hypothetical company, ''ABC Inc.''


  Create separate accounts for:

  Revenues (e.g. sales, services, investments)


  Expenses (e.g. payroll, rent, supplies, utilities)


  Assets (e.g. cash, inventory, equipment)


  Liabilities (e.g. debts, loans, credit cards)


  Provide examples for the following:


  Income Statement: Calculate revenue and net income for Q1-Q4

  Balance Sheet: Report asset, liability, and equity values for the same period


  Include an example of how to handle journal entries for expenses, sales tax, and
  depreciation.


  Consider a scenario where the business experiences fluctuations in cash flow and
  provide suggestions for managing these changes.


  Ensure scalability for 2-3 additional employees and account types.


  How would you modify the system to account for changes in government regulations,
  industry standards, or new tax laws?'
